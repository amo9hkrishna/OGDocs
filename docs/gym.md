# Gym

Hello, if you've clicked on this page, you're looking for gym info. Luckily for you, I'm always happy to help out.

Please keep in mind though, this is only advice and I'd recommend taking whatever's written here not as gospel, but purely as something to build off of. Basically, take it with a grain of salt, if you will. But not too much, it's not good for health `:)`

## Metrics
Here are some metrics you would most probably know about yourself. Maybe I could also call these `Prereqs`. Or even `Prereqmetrics`. I don't know, still a work in progress, but anyway:

**Height** : How far the top of your head is from the ground

**Weight** : How much the ground resists you 

**Body Fat (BF) Percentage** : How much of your body is related to ... I probably shouldn't say that, that's not nice. You know what this is. 

**Goals** : It can be something like ->

1. Gain Muscle Mass
2. Improve Cardiovascular Strength (Endurance)

**Strengths**: Could be things such as ->

1. You're on the leaner side
2. You have good cardio

and so on.

**Weaknesses**: Could be things such as ->

1. Your legs are less developed or have less propensity for growth
2. Your cardio is suboptimal

and so on.

> These are all just examples btw

With this in mind, for the short term (until approximately June 2025), I think bulking is the next step.

I’ll also touch on body recomposition, just for general knowledge, but this is sort of meh, for lack of a better word/phrase. I’ll explain what it is and why it’s meh in the next section.

## What is Bulking?

Bulking is simply putting on weight. There are 2 types of bulking:

1. **Clean Bulk**: Gaining muscle without accumulating EXCESS body fat. It’s called clean bulking because you’re supposed to bulk with “clean” (healthy) food. Nutrient Dense. Nah Mean?
2. **Dirty Bulk**: Gaining weight. Doesn’t matter if it’s fat or muscle. You consume food based on its existence. If it’s in front of you, you’re going to eat it. Regardless of its nutrient content. 
    1. Dirty bulking typically involves consuming large quantities of junk food, processed foods, and high-calorie fast foods, which are often high in saturated fat, sugar, and salt (These types of foods are under the category of **hyper-palatable foods.** Basically what America runs on!**)**. 
    2. This approach can lead to rapid weight gain, including muscle mass and fat, but also an almost disproportionate increase in body fat. 
    3. Therefore, this approach is pretty unhealthy but is somewhat of a Hail Mary. 

## What is Body Recomposition?

It’s essentially trying to preserve and build muscle while losing fat at the same time. In more recent literature, it’s known as ‘maingaining’, which is one V away from sounding like something Trump wants to grab (lol).

Before, I used to be a fan of body recomposition (I’ve never done it tbh but I’ve recommended it before to my friends who stand to gain and lose, so to speak) but nowadays, thanks to new research, it’s better to just choose to actively gain or lose ‘mass’ (colloquially known as cutting or bulking) rather than oscillating between the two. 

Now, this whole bulking, cutting, body recomposition, et cetera et cetera, all of these ‘practices’ mainly depend on nutrition. The workout is pretty much going to be the same the only difference will be the nutrition.

We’ll get to that further.

Just for general knowledge though, the number of repetitions (reps) you perform and the weights used are the slight differences between cutting, bulking and body recomposition when considering the workout plan.

Since you’re also quite new to weightlifting/gym/resistance training (but not exercise in general you Indian Usain Bolt), you’ll get newbie gains, which would be better ‘nurtured’ if we stick to classic bulking. 



## Know your Genetics

Having a basic rubric regarding your genetics is a must. I’ll explain with an example.

In my case, my dad has well developed shoulders and a well developed back. And he’s never touched weights seriously in his life, which is so fucking unfair lol, but we move, can’t deny dad strength. My mom has a lot of lower body muscle mass. Therefore, I’ve inherited these traits.

Essentially, what I’m trying to say is using genetics, you can identify your strengths and which parts of your body are easy to develop. 

You can also figure out your lacunas and stress on those parts of the body. 

Again, in my case, it’s my inability to shred easily because both of my parents tend to hold on to fat more.

I will give you this; genetics is only a RUBRIC. At the end of the day, hard work beats talent. Or in this case, genetics.

## Nutrition

Nutrition is the key in the realm of health and fitness. If you’re not eating (somewhat) right, then there’s no point.

I’ve mentioned the types of bulking so this can kind of segue from that.

There are two types of nutrients that we require to survive and thrive:

1. Macronutrients: Nutrients that the body requires in higher quantities for growth, energy, etc. I want you to guess which these are.
2. Micronutrients: Nutrients that the body requires in lower quantities for metabolism, hormone regulation, and so on. Again, I’m sure you can guess these. 

This is something we can calculate, otherwise I’ll add a section for the calculation later on. 

### Calories

The formal definition of calorie is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius.

Basically, it’s just a unit of energy used pretty much everywhere. It shows how much energy something will give you be it food or beverage.

Imma hit you with some biology.

We (humans, mammals, students of Tandon) have a special type of metabolism known as catabolism. The prefix cata is derived from the Greek word ‘kata’ meaning ‘down’. I’m assuming you’ve seen words similar to catabolism like catastrophe, cataclysm, etc. (I’m getting distracted sorry). Basically, catabolism is the type of metabolism that involves breaking down of bigger nutrients or molecules into smaller ones. 

And since we possess catabolism, it means that our body is constantly breaking things down. Which means that **we’re always expending energy.** 

Anything we do, we’ll burn calories. Even sleeping burns calories (that’s what she said)(it’s around 60 calories)(normal sleeping not…).

Therefore, in order to gain weight be it fat or muscle, our calorie intake should be greater than our calorie expenditure.

If you burn 2000 calories throughout the day and only eat 1800 calories, there’s a **calorie deficit** of 200 calories.

If you burn 2000 calories and eat 2200 calories, there’s a **calorie surplus** of 200 calories.

So, you need to be in **Calorie Surplus.**

The higher the difference of calories, the greater the cut or bulk.

### Maintenance Calories

Your body needs some amount of energy to run, right?

Basically to **maintain** it (duh).

There are a number of ways to calculate Maintenance Calories and it depends on how active you are, your current weight, and so on. 

I’ll add a section for the calculation part here later on too, if needed. 

Essentially, to bulk or gain weight or mass, your calorie intake should be greater than your maintenance calories.

Recommended surplus should be around 200-300 calories to start off. Later on, it can be tweaked if required.

## Exercise

Now you know exercise is good for you but it’s also essential in building muscle, improving your physique and joints and overall getting fit.

I know you’ll take care of cardio, that’s pretty familiar for you.

I’d recommend doing cardio 3 days a week if you’re hitting the gym 4-5 days a week.

Doing cardio like skipping rope, jogging on the treadmill, Stairmaster, etc. for a good 20 mins is perfect.

Keep it to a max of 30 mins though.

Now let’s look into resistance training. 

Formal Definition: Resistance training a.k.a. strength training or weight training is a form of exercise that involves using resistance to induce muscular contractions with the goal of improving muscular strength, power, and endurance. 

The resistance can be provided by various means such as free weights, weight machines, resistance bands, or body weight, blah blah blah.

I’ll give you **6-7 variations** per day, however, since you’re just starting I’ll highlight the ones you should aim to do, and for a decent time period, I’ll give you probably **4-5** variations for now.

Try and pick a weight that is moderately challenging: 

it shouldn’t be too easy to the point where you can bang out 30 reps

It shouldn’t be too hard to the point where you’re struggling to pick up the weight let alone get into proper form.

And always prioritize form. 

FORM >>>>>> WEIGHTS

Good form equals good frame.

Also, I want to make a mix of hypertrophy and strength training after getting comfortable with hypertrophy. 

Hypertrophy is for building muscle and it’s basically 12-15 reps per set and approx 1-3 mins of rest. The weights shouldn’t be too heavy, medium light if that makes sense. 

Strength training is for strength (duh). Rep range is 5-8 and approx 3-4 mins of rest. You should go as heavy as **SAFELY** possible. 

For now, we’ll focus on hypertrophy. Then we’ll specialize on strength training. Besides, you’ll gain strength on a hypertrophy rep range anyway. 

## Rest

Your sleep schedule is pretty decent, so I won’t be on this section so much, but overall rest from the gym is important and it doesn’t solely mean sleeping. Here are some tips for sleep though in case you need it:

Try to get 7 hours of sleep.

Try and avoid blue light 2 hours before bed.

If you have trouble sleeping you can take some melatonin.

Try and have your dinner early too. It helps me quite a bit tbh. 

Try and incorporate 2 rest days per week. On rest days, you can do light cardio or just go out walking, the weather’s nice and it’ll also be super nice in Cali. 

I used to disregard rest days and it backfired on me so give your muscles time to recover.

Also, just mentioning again, for strength training, you should rest approx 3-4 mins after each set.

And for hypertrophy, you should rest approx 1-3 mins after each set. 

## Calculations

Estimated Maintenance Calories: 45 Calories * Lean Body Mass

Lean Body Mass = (100 - Estimated Body Fat)/100 * Body Weight

## Split

Now there are many different splits but for beginning and for your body type I’d say the **Arnold Split** is what we’ll start off with.

The Arnold Split is very simple.

It’s perfect for beginners.

One day is reserved for two muscles (or muscle group).

For example:

Monday: Chest and Tris

Tuesday: Back and Biceps

Wednesday: Legs and Shoulders

Thursday: Chest and Tris

Friday: Back and Biceps

Saturday: Legs and Shoulders

Sunday: Rest

You can also keep your rest day in between the week as well, if needed. You can also have another rest day but since the variations are on the lower side, try to make it to the gym 6 days a week. It’ll help with building the muscle memory.

There are a bunch of other splits, but this split works best for you for now, we can always tweak if needed later on. 

Typically, your workout session should look like this:

Start off with some light cardio (besides aforementioned cardio sessions) like jumping jacks, arm circles, dynamic stretching, etc. That’ll serve as a warmup.

I’d recommend something like this:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzNBx_B4pQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzNBx_B4pQ4)

You can also just walk on the treadmill for 10 minutes.

Then do some resistance training using the split I mentioned earlier. (Refer example)

Lastly do some light stretching (cooldown).

### Sample Chest and Triceps Routine (1):

Pushups : 2 sets, till failure (don’t skip this, it serves as warm up for lifting)

Incline Bench Press(Barbell or Dumbbell)(Dumbbell is better for form): 3 sets, 10 reps each

Single Arm Cable Extension: 3 sets, 15 reps each (each arm should hit 15 reps)

Double Arm Cable Vertical Skullcrusher: 3 sets, 15 reps each (this one I think I’ll have to demonstrate in person)

### Sample Back and Biceps Routine (1):

Pullups: 2 sets, till failure (don’t skip this, it serves as warm up for lifting)

Calf Raise: Till Failure (don’t skip this, it’s very important)

Now, I know the volume for Legs and Shoulders is a bit more than the other ones, but that’s mainly because your legs can take a lot of damage, and they’re also huge in terms of amount of muscle compared to the rest of your body.

Let’s start with this for now, and we can tweak it later on, take away some exercises, replace some, etc. 

Now, there are usually 1-2 exercises per day that train a specific subpart of the muscle group, specifically the bigger/more complex muscle groups like the chest, back, shoulders and legs.  

**For Chest:** 

1. Presses build your overall chest thickness.
2. Incline builds your upper chest.
3. Flies build your overall chest width.
4. Pullover is for your lower chest.

**For Back:**

1. The pulldown exercises build the width of your back
2. The rows build your midback and overall thickness of your back. 

**For Shoulders:** 

1. The lateral raises build your side delts.
2. The Farmer’s Walk builds your traps.
3. The presses build your front delts.
4. The rear flies hit your rear delts.

**For Legs:** 

1. The squats hit the quads and glutes (mainly quads).
2. The lunges hit the quads and glutes (mainly glutes).
3. The curls hit the hamstrings.
4. The leg press also hits your quads and glutes (you can alternate the effect based on your foot placement).

Your chest, back, shoulders and legs can be considered more complex muscle groups, and they usually require different movements for their overall growth. 

Therefore, make sure you hit all of the exercises mentioned for these complex ones. If you do feel tired or low on energy, don’t skip the variation all together, do a lower amount of reps or do only 2 sets instead of 3, or use lighter weights, etc. 

I’ve kept some of them till failure, if you wish you can train all variations to failure, it’s up to you. 

If you have any questions you can video call me or just go to YouTube and search the names of the exercise.

Or you can ask people in the gym; gymrats are nice guys and are always supportive `:)`

### Nutrition Instructions

For now, just keep it healthy honestly. Let’s get in habit with the workouts then the nutrition will fall in place. When in doubt about a food product, think to yourself, “Would this be there in my grandparents’ time?” If the answer’s no, don’t eat too much of it.

Try to get more protein in. Usually, when you want to start meal prepping, the consensus for optimal amount of protein is 0.7g per pound of body weight. 

While opting for chicken, go for chicken thighs as opposed to chicken breasts. It’ll help with putting on mass.

Turkey is also great for protein content, and it’s quite lean.

Vegetarian options are legumes, lentils, paneer, chickpeas, etc. 

Greek yoghurt is also a good option. 

Down the line we can start tracking your macros.

### Additional Instructions

Make sure you get your vitamins checked out. It can give you a lot of insight on what micronutrients you may be lacking.

## Takeaways

I know this is a lot of information, but honestly it’s fundamentally quite simple. It’s not easy though.

But I’ve seen how consistent you are with assignments and work, and I’m trying to get like you, bro in terms of having your shit together. So I **know** for a fact, you’ll smash this out of the park. 

Just a disclaimer though: 

Take it slow and pace yourself.

Initially, it’s best for you to take it slow and increase the intensity or discipline as you go (this is called progressive overload).

Don’t go apeshit with heavy weights, and always keep an eye on form.

I’m legally obligated to give you these disclaimers, so you know how this is.

I don’t think you need this reminder lol, but regardless: 

## GO HAM

(It stands for something; I want you to guess later. It’s also my little Easter Egg. Good luck finding it ;) )

I think that’s it for now.

In case you want me to add anything let me know I’ll update the sheet and send it to you.

Don’t worry if you’re confused, we’re here to help. 

You got this.
