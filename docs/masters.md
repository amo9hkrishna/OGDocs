# LORs

- First, figure out who you plan on asking for LOR
- It's best to ask a professor you're close to or a project guide 
- Your second LOR can be from your HoD or other executive members of the college/university, if he/she taught you or knows you relatively well
- Secondly, list all of your achievements and classify them: 
	- Academic
	- Technical
	- Extracurricular : Can be further split into Athletics, Cultural, Event Organization / Event Management, and so on

Format I used:

1. Introduction : Basically saying, "I'm supporting your decision for Masters and I'm recommending you"
2. Paragraph about CS/Academics/Projects : Spoke about Personal Projects, Hackathon Projects
3. Small Paragraph about Placement : I wrote about o9 and how I got placed. 
4. Extracurricular Paragraph
5. Conclusion: Pretty Self Explanatory

- Add personality traits that align with academics and work in the 2nd paragraph
- Add personality traits that conclude your contribution to your Department
- Add personality traits, soft skills and technical skills in conclusion 
- Make sure you evenly spread the extracurricular activities and technical projects across both LORs; don't exhaust all of the important things for one LOR
